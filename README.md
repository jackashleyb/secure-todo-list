# 🔒 Secure Todo List - Python + AWS Cloud Integration

A simple, secure todo list application built in Python with AWS S3 cloud integration, designed as a learning project for cybersecurity and cloud computing fundamentals.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a basic application with security best practices and cloud integration. It's perfect for beginners learning Python, cybersecurity concepts, and AWS cloud services.

## 🚀 Features

### Security Features
- **Password Protection**: Simple 3-attempt password system
- **Input Validation**: Error handling for invalid inputs
- **Secure File Handling**: Safe JSON file operations with error checking
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Uses AWS configuration files

### Cloud Integration
- **AWS S3 Storage**: Automatic backup to cloud storage
- **Dual Storage**: Local files + cloud sync
- **Region Configuration**: EU North (Stockholm) for GDPR compliance
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if cloud services are unavailable

### Core Functionality
- **Add Todos**: Simple text input for new tasks
- **View Todos**: Display all tasks with completion status
- **Mark Complete**: Check off completed items
- **Sync from Cloud**: Download latest data from S3
- **Persistent Storage**: Data survives program restarts

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Python 3.9+**: Core application logic
- **boto3**: AWS SDK for Python
- **JSON**: Data storage format
- **AWS S3**: Cloud storage service
- **AWS CLI**: Command-line interface for AWS

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- AWS CLI configured
- AWS S3 bucket created

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd secure-todo-list
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip3 install boto3
   ```

3. **Configure AWS**
   ```bash
   aws configure
   # Enter your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, and Region
   ```

4. **Create S3 bucket** (if not exists)
   ```bash
   aws s3 mb s3://your-bucket-name --region your-region
   ```

5. **Update bucket name in code**
   ```python
   bucket_name = "your-bucket-name"  # in todo_basic.py
   ```

### Running the Application

```bash
python3 todo_basic.py
```

**Default Password**: `1234` (change this in the code!)

## 🔐 Security Features Explained

### Password Protection
- Simple 3-attempt limit prevents brute force attacks
- Easy to extend with more sophisticated authentication
- Foundation for learning about access control

### Input Validation
- Checks for valid numbers and data types
- Prevents common input-based attacks
- Good practice for secure application development

### File Security
- Safe file operations with proper error handling
- No sensitive data exposed in error messages
- Foundation for secure file handling practices

## ☁️ Cloud Integration Explained

### Why AWS S3?
- **Scalability**: Handles unlimited data growth
- **Reliability**: 99.99% availability guarantee
- **Security**: Built-in encryption and access controls
- **Cost-effective**: Pay only for what you use

### How It Works
1. **Local First**: Always saves to local file first
2. **Cloud Sync**: Automatically uploads to S3
3. **Fallback**: If cloud fails, local data is preserved
4. **Bidirectional**: Can sync from cloud back to local

### Data Flow
```
User Input → Local JSON → AWS S3
     ↓           ↓         ↓
   Validate   Save File  Upload Cloud
```
